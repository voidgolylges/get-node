The film is a complex and provocative exploration of human relationships, sexuality and morality. The film shows how the characters are driven by their desires, fears and fantasies, and how they cope with the consequences of their actions. The film also examines the themes of loneliness, alienation and communication in the modern urban society.
 
The film is notable for its realistic and graphic depiction of sex, which has been compared to the works of Michael Winterbottom and Catherine Breillat. The film uses sex as a way to reveal the characters' emotions, motivations and conflicts, and to create a contrast between their physical intimacy and their emotional distance. The film also challenges the viewers' expectations and judgments by showing different perspectives and outcomes of the same situations.
 
The film received critical acclaim for its direction, cinematography, editing and acting. The film was praised for its bold and original vision, its artistic style and its psychological depth. The film was also criticized for its excessive nudity, its bleak and pessimistic tone and its lack of sympathy for the characters. The film divided the audiences and sparked debates on its artistic merit and social relevance.
  
The film was also a commercial failure, as it was only released in a few countries and had a limited theatrical run. The film was banned in Singapore and Malaysia for its explicit content, and received an NC-17 rating in the United States. The film was also poorly marketed and distributed, as it faced competition from other mainstream and independent films.
 
However, the film also gained a cult following among some viewers who appreciated its artistic merits and its daring approach to sexuality. The film was also recognized by some festivals and awards, such as the Locarno International Film Festival, where it was nominated for the Golden Leopard, and the European Film Awards, where it was nominated for the Best Cinematography Award. The film also won the FIPRESCI Prize at the Thessaloniki Film Festival and the Best Director Award at the Mar del Plata Film Festival.
 
The film has been compared to other films that deal with similar themes and styles, such as Eyes Wide Shut (1999), Intimacy (2001), 9 Songs (2004), Shortbus (2006) and Blue Is the Warmest Colour (2013). The film has also been seen as an example of the New Austrian Cinema, a movement that emerged in the late 1990s and early 2000s, characterized by its realism, social criticism and aesthetic experimentation.
