## How to Play Stranded Deep v0.03 - Hotfix 2 (64bit)?
 
Stranded Deep is a challenging game that requires you to use your skills and creativity to survive. There are many things to learn and discover, but here are some basic tips to help you get started:

- Build a water still immediately. Water is essential for survival, and coconuts are not enough. You need to craft a water still from palm fronds, cloth, rocks, and a coconut flask. The water still will collect rainwater or condense moisture from the air. You need to drink at least one coconut flask of water per day[^1^].
- Beware of poisonous sea life. The ocean is full of dangers, such as sharks, stingrays, lionfish, and sea urchins. If you get bitten or stung by any of these creatures, you will get poisoned and lose health over time. You need to craft an antidote from pipi plants, which can be found on some islands or underwater[^2^].
- Save your game frequently. Stranded Deep does not autosave, so you need to manually save your game at a shelter. You can craft a shelter from palm fronds, sticks, and lashings. Saving your game will also allow you to sleep and skip the night[^3^].
- Know your vitals. You have four vitals to monitor: health, hunger, thirst, and sunstroke. You can check them by looking at your survival watch, which also shows the time and date. You need to keep your vitals high by eating, drinking, resting, and staying in the shade. If your vitals drop too low, you will die[^4^].
- Do not leave your island without preparation. Your starting island has limited resources, so you will need to explore other islands eventually. However, you should not venture out without proper equipment and supplies. You need a raft with a sail or a motor, a compass, a knife, a spear or a speargun, food and water, bandages and antidotes, and a flare gun or a signal fire for rescue[^5^].

These are just some of the basic tips for playing Stranded Deep v0.03 - Hotfix 2 (64bit). There are many more things to discover and learn as you play this immersive survival game.
