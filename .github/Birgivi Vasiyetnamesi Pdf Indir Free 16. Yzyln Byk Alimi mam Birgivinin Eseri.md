## Imam Birgivi: A Biography of a Reformer
 
Imam Birgivi was born as Muhammad ibn Pir Ali in Balikesir, Turkey, in 1522. He was the son of a renowned scholar and teacher, Pir Ali, who instilled in him the love of learning and virtue. He pursued his studies in Istanbul, the capital of the Ottoman Empire, where he excelled in theology and law. He became a judge and a teacher, but he also had a strong inclination for spirituality and Sufism. He joined the Bayramiyyah order and became a disciple of Shaykh Abdurrahman Karamani.
 
However, Imam Birgivi was not satisfied with his worldly career and position. He felt a calling to renounce the world and devote himself to God alone. He resigned from his post as a judge and returned his salary to the treasury. He sought permission from his Sufi master to become an ascetic, but he was advised to use his talents and knowledge for the benefit of the Muslim community. He was appointed as the head teacher of a madrasah (religious school) in Birgi, a town near Izmir, where he acquired his nickname Birgivi.

In Birgi, Imam Birgivi dedicated himself to teaching and writing. He authored 27 books on various topics of Islamic sciences, such as jurisprudence, theology, ethics, Quranic recitation, and dogmatics. His most famous work is Vasiyetname (The Testament), which is a comprehensive guide for Muslims on how to live according to the Quran and Sunnah (the teachings and example of Prophet Muhammad). The book covers all aspects of Islamic beliefs and practices, from the pillars of faith and worship to the rules of social and economic relations. The book is widely regarded as one of the most authoritative sources of Hanafi fiqh (Islamic law) in the Ottoman Empire and beyond.
 
Imam Birgivi was not only a scholar and a teacher, but also a reformer and a critic. He was deeply concerned about the moral decline and corruption that plagued the Muslim society of his time. He denounced the deviations and innovations that had crept into Islamic teachings and practices, especially among the rulers and the wealthy classes. He advocated for a return to the original purity and simplicity of Islam, as practiced by Prophet Muhammad and his companions. He also urged Muslims to uphold justice, honesty, charity, and piety in their personal and public lives.
 
Imam Birgivi's bold stance earned him many admirers as well as enemies. He was respected by some high-ranking officials and scholars, such as Ataullah Efendi, the teacher of Sultan Selim II, who supported his reformist efforts. He was also revered by many students and followers who adopted his teachings and spread them throughout the Muslim world. However, he also faced opposition and hostility from those who felt threatened by his criticism and challenge. He was accused of being a troublemaker, a fanatic, or even a heretic by some of his opponents.
 
Imam Birgivi remained steadfast in his mission until his death from the plague in 1573 at the age of 51. He left behind a legacy of Islamic scholarship and moral leadership that continues to inspire Muslims today. His books are still studied and taught in many Islamic institutions and universities. His example is still admired and emulated by many Muslims who seek to follow the path of Muhammad.
