Mentes Extraordinarias (Extraordinary Minds) is a book by Howard Gardner, a renowned psychologist and researcher who is best known for his theory of multiple intelligences.

The book was originally published in English in 1997 as Extraordinary Minds: Portraits of 4 Exceptional Individuals and an Examination of Our Own Extraordinariness. It was translated into Spanish by Alfonso ColodrÃ³n and published by Rocco in 1998. The book is divided into four parts, each dedicated to one of the extraordinary minds. Gardner uses a variety of sources, such as biographies, letters, diaries, works and testimonies, to reconstruct their personal and professional trajectories. He also compares and contrasts them with other figures from their fields and eras.
 
Gardner argues that these four individuals represent different types of extraordinary minds: Mozart was a master, who achieved excellence in his domain at an early age; Freud was a maker, who created a new discipline and a new way of understanding human nature; Woolf was an introspector, who explored her own inner world and expressed it in innovative forms; and Gandhi was an influencer, who changed the course of history through his moral vision and nonviolent action. Gardner suggests that these types are not mutually exclusive, but rather complementary aspects of human potential.
 
Gardner also reflects on the factors that contribute to the development of extraordinary minds, such as genetic endowment, family background, education, mentors, peers, historical context, personal crises and social movements. He acknowledges that there is no simple formula for producing or identifying extraordinary minds, but rather a complex interplay of multiple elements. He also warns that extraordinary minds are not necessarily happy or well-adjusted, as they often face difficulties, conflicts and opposition from others.
 
Gardner concludes the book by asking what it means to be extraordinary in our own times and how we can cultivate our own exceptional abilities. He proposes that we need to recognize and respect the diversity of human intelligences and talents, as well as the commonalities that bind us as a species. He also encourages us to pursue our passions and interests, to challenge ourselves and to seek feedback from others. He asserts that we all have the potential to be extraordinary in some way, if we are willing to work hard and to learn from our experiences.
