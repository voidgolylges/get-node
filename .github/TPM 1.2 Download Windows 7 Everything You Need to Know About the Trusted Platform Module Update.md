TPM (Trusted Platform Module) is a security chip that can protect your device and data from unauthorized access. TPM 1.2 is an older version of TPM that may have some security vulnerabilities. Microsoft has released Windows 10 security updates to address these vulnerabilities, but you also need to update your TPM firmware and clear your TPM to ensure your device is fully protected.

In this article, we will show you how to download and install TPM 1.2 firmware update for Windows 7 devices. Note that this process may vary depending on your device manufacturer and model. If you have a Surface device, see [Security issue for TPM on Surface devices](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/security-issue-for-tpm-on-surface-devices-8f9f0c9a-6b0a-4b0c-8c9f-3d6db0a86b03) for more information and instructions.
 
## Step 1: Download and install the Windows operating system updates from Windows Update
 
If you have turned on automatic updates in Windows Update, you donât need to take any action because the updates will be downloaded and installed automatically. If you have not turned on automatic updates, we recommend that you go to Windows Update immediately to check for and install the applicable updates manually. To learn more, see [Windows Update: FAQ](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-update-faq-8a903416-6f45-0718-f5c5-df792e68ce18).
 
Warning: Do not apply the TPM firmware update before you apply the Windows operating system update. Doing so will make it impossible to determine whether your system is affected.
 
## Step 2: Install any applicable firmware updates
 
If your device is not from Microsoft, locate the device manufacturer of your device in the following table, select the corresponding link, and apply the firmware update that's provided. If your device manufacturer isn't listed in this table, contact the manufacturerâs customer support department.
