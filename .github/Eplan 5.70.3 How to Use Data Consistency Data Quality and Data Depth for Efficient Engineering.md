EPLAN 5.70.3 is an old version of the electrical engineering software that was released in 2007. It is no longer supported by the developer and may not be compatible with newer operating systems and hardware. If you have some EPLAN 5.70.3 projects that you want to update or reuse, you may need to convert them to EPLAN P8 2.7, which is the latest version as of 2023.
 
However, converting EPLAN 5.70.3 projects to EPLAN P8 2.7 is not a straightforward process. You cannot simply open the old projects in the new software and expect them to work. There are some steps and precautions that you need to follow to ensure a successful conversion.

In this article, we will show you how to convert EPLAN 5.70.3 projects to EPLAN P8 2.7 using a built-in function in the software and a third-party tool that can automate the process for multiple projects.
  
## Using the Built-in Function in EPLAN P8 2.7
 
EPLAN P8 2.7 has a hidden function that allows you to convert EPLAN 5.70.3 projects to the new format. To access this function, you need to do the following:
 
1. Open EPLAN P8 2.7 and create a new project.
2. Go to **Utilities** > **Settings** > **User** > **Interface**.
3. In the **Interface** dialog box, click on the **Customize** button.
4. In the **Customize User Interface** dialog box, go to the **Commands** tab.
5. In the **Categories** list, select **All Commands**.
6. In the **Commands** list, scroll down and find the command called **Eplan5ImportProjectAction**.
7. Drag and drop this command to any toolbar or menu that you want.
8. Click on **OK** to close the dialog boxes.
9. You should now see a new icon or menu item for the **Eplan5ImportProjectAction** command.
10. To use this command, click on it and browse for the EPLAN 5.70.3 project file (.ELK) that you want to convert.
11. The software will then import the project and create a new project file (.ELP8) in the same folder as the original file.
12. You can then open the new project file and check if everything is converted correctly.

Note that this function may not work for all EPLAN 5.70.3 projects, especially if they have complex symbols, articles, macros, or other features that are not compatible with EPLAN P8 2.7. You may need to manually adjust some settings or elements after the conversion.
  
## Using a Third-Party Tool for Batch Conversion
 
If you have many EPLAN 5.70.3 projects that you want to convert to EPLAN P8 2.7, using the built-in function may be tedious and time-consuming. You may want to use a third-party tool that can automate the process for batch conversion.
