## What is Kontakt 5.3.0?
 
Kontakt 5.3.0 is a software sampler that allows you to play and manipulate sounds from a wide range of sources, such as recorded samples, synthesized waveforms, or physical modeling engines. You can load sounds from Kontakt's own factory library, which contains over 1000 instruments and 43 GB of content, or from third-party libraries that are powered by Kontakt.
 
Kontakt 5.3.0 also lets you create your own instruments by importing your own samples, or by using the built-in sound generators and effects. You can edit and process your sounds with a powerful scripting engine, a flexible modulation system, and a comprehensive set of filters and effects.
 
Kontakt 5.3.0 can be used as a standalone application, or as a plug-in in your favorite DAW (digital audio workstation). You can also integrate it with other Native Instruments products, such as Maschine, Komplete Kontrol, or Reaktor.
 
## What's new in Kontakt 5.3.0?
 
Kontakt 5.3.0 introduces several improvements and enhancements over the previous versions, such as:
 
- A new instrument bus system that allows you to route multiple instruments to a single output channel, with individual volume and pan controls.
- A new time-stretching mode that preserves the formants and transients of your sounds, for more natural-sounding pitch-shifting and tempo changes.
- A new instrument header that displays the most important parameters of your instrument at a glance, such as volume, pan, tuning, polyphony, and MIDI channel.
- A new instrument icon that shows a graphical representation of your instrument's structure and layout.
- A new quick-load catalog that lets you access your favorite instruments and patches with a single click.
- A new purge function that lets you free up memory by removing unused samples from your instrument.
- A new AET (Authentic Expression Technology) filter that allows you to morph between different articulations of an instrument based on velocity or MIDI controller input.
- A new time machine pro mode that offers high-quality time-stretching and pitch-shifting for complex sounds and loops.
- A new convolution effect that lets you apply realistic reverb and other spatial effects to your sounds.
- A new tape saturator effect that adds warmth and harmonic distortion to your sounds.
- A new transient master effect that lets you shape the attack and sustain of your sounds.
- A new solid G-EQ effect that offers a four-band equalizer with switchable modes and curves.
- A new solid bus comp effect that offers a classic analog-style compressor with side-chain input and parallel compression.
