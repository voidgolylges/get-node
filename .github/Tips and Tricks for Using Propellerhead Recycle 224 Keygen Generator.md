## How to use Recycle to load, chop, edit, and process loops
 
Once you have created a new project in Recycle, you can start loading loops into it. You can either drag and drop audio files from your computer or browse them from the file menu. Recycle supports a variety of audio formats, such as WAV, AIFF, MP3, OGG, and REX. You can also record your own loops using a microphone or an external device.
 
When you load a loop into Recycle, it will automatically analyze it and slice it into smaller pieces called slices. Each slice corresponds to a transient or a beat in the loop. You can see the slices as vertical lines on the waveform display. You can also zoom in and out of the waveform using the mouse wheel or the zoom buttons.
 
Recycle gives you a lot of control over how to chop and edit your loops. You can add, delete, move, or resize slices using the mouse or the keyboard shortcuts. You can also adjust the sensitivity of the slicing algorithm using the slider at the bottom of the screen. You can preview your loop by pressing the spacebar or clicking on the play button.
 
One of the main features of Recycle is that it lets you change the tempo and pitch of your loop independently. This means that you can speed up or slow down your loop without affecting its pitch, or change its pitch without affecting its tempo. You can do this by using the sliders at the top of the screen or by typing in numerical values. You can also lock the tempo or pitch to a specific value using the lock buttons.
 
Another feature of Recycle is that it lets you process each slice individually with effects and filters. You can access these options by clicking on the "FX" button at the top right corner of the screen. You will see a list of effects and filters that you can apply to your slices, such as EQ, compressor, distortion, reverb, delay, chorus, flanger, phaser, and more. You can adjust the parameters of each effect or filter using the knobs and sliders below them. You can also turn on or off each effect or filter using the buttons next to them.
