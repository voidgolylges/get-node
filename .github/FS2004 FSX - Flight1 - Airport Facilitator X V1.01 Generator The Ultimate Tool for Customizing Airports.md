## How to install and run AFX
 
To install AFX, you need to download the installer from the Flight1 website[^1^]. The installer will ask you for your name, email address and a valid order number. You can obtain an order number by purchasing AFX from the Flight1 website or by using the Flight1 key generator[^3^]. After entering your information, the installer will copy the files to your hard drive and create a shortcut on your desktop.
 
To run AFX, you need to double-click on the shortcut or go to Start Menu > Programs > Flight One Software > Airport Facilitator X. You will see the main window of AFX with a menu bar, a toolbar, a status bar and a map area. The map area shows a map of the world with airports marked by blue dots. You can zoom in and out using the mouse wheel or the buttons on the toolbar. You can also pan the map by clicking and dragging with the left mouse button.
 
## How to connect AFX to Flight Simulator
 
To connect AFX to Flight Simulator, you need to run both programs at the same time. You also need to install a special AFX module that allows communication between them. The module is included in the AFX installation and is located in the Modules folder of your Flight Simulator directory. The module name is either F1\_AFX\_FS9.dll for FS2004 or F1\_AFX\_FSX.dll for FSX.
 
To enable the module, you need to edit the dll.xml file that is located in the same folder as your fs9.exe or fsx.exe file. You can use any text editor such as Notepad to open the file. You need to add the following lines inside the <simbase.document> tag:</simbase.document>
  ```xml <launch.addon>
  <name>Airport Facilitator X Module</name>
  <disabled>False</disabled>
  <manualload>False</manualload>
  <path>Modules\F1_AFX_FS9.dll</path> <!-- For FS2004 -->
  <!-- <Path>Modules\F1_AFX_FSX.dll</Path> --> <!-- For FSX -->
</launch.addon> ```  
You need to uncomment (remove <!-- and -->) the appropriate line depending on your Flight Simulator version. Save the file and close it.
 
To connect AFX to Flight Simulator, you need to start both programs and load a flight at any airport. Then, go to AFX and click on Connect > Connect To FS on the menu bar or press Ctrl+C on your keyboard. You will see a message saying "Connected To FS" on the status bar of AFX. You can also see a green dot next to your plane position on the map area of AFX.
 
## How to import and export airports in AFX
 
To import an airport in AFX, you need to click on File > Import Airport on the menu bar or press Ctrl+I on your keyboard. You will see a dialog box where you can select an airport from a list of stock and add-on airports that are installed in your Flight Simulator directory. You can also type an ICAO code or a partial name of an airport in the search box to filter the list. Click on OK when you have selected
