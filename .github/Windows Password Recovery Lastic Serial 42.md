## Step 2: Create a bootable CD/DVD or USB flash drive
 
Windows Password Recovery Lastic Serial 42 can create a bootable CD/DVD or USB flash drive that contains a special tiny version of a Linux-type OS and all required program files. To create a bootable device, launch the software and click on the "Create Bootable Disk" button. Then, select the type of device you want to use and follow the instructions on the screen.
 
## Step 3: Boot from the bootable device and launch the program
 
After creating the bootable device, insert it into the computer that you want to reset the password for and restart it. You may need to change the boot order in the BIOS settings to make sure that the computer boots from the device. Once the computer boots from the device, you will see a menu with several options. Choose "Windows Password Recovery Lastic" and press Enter.
 
## Step 4: Remove or restore your Windows password
 
The program will automatically detect all user accounts of all Windows installed on your disks. You can see the list of accounts and their password statuses on the main window.

To restore a password hash, select the account you want to restore and click on the "Save Hashes" button.

This option may take a long time depending on the complexity of the password.
 
## Step 5: Restart your computer and log in with your new password
 
After removing or restoring your Windows password, you can restart your computer and remove the bootable device. You should be able to log in to your account with your new password or without any password if you removed it.
